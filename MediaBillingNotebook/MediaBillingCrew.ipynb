    "## 📚 Complete PDF Integration Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What's Been Added:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PDF Reading Functions**: Extract text from any PDF file\n",
    "2. **Product Info Parser**: Structure PDF content for AI agents\n",
    "3. **Sample PDF Creator**: Generate test PDFs with product info\n",
    "4. **Updated Tasks**: Research task now accepts PDF input\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 How to Use PDF Input (3 Options):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 1: Use Existing PDF File**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# In the \"DEFINE TASKS\" cell, uncomment and update:\n",
    "pdf_path = \"path/to/your/product.pdf\"\n",
    "product_info = extract_product_info_from_pdf(pdf_path)\n",
    "product_context = product_info['full_content']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 2: Create Sample PDF**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Run the helper cell above:\n",
    "sample_pdf = create_sample_product_pdf()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Option 3: Upload Your Own PDF**\n",
    "1. Place your PDF in the notebook directory\n",
    "2. Update the `pdf_path` variable\n",
    "3. Re-run the tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 PDF Format Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your PDF should include:**\n",
    "- Product name (first line/heading)\n",
    "- Key features and specifications\n",
    "- Target audience information\n",
    "- Competitive advantages\n",
    "- Pricing details\n",
    "- Any marketing angles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example PDF Structure:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Product Name: iPhone 17\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "- Feature 1\n",
    "- Feature 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Market:\n",
    "- Demographic 1\n",
    "- Demographic 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Pricing: $999-$1499\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Benefits of PDF Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Reusable** - Use same PDF for multiple campaigns  \n",
    "✅ **Collaborative** - Share PDFs with team members  \n",
    "✅ **Organized** - Keep product briefs separate from code  \n",
    "✅ **Flexible** - Easy to update product information  \n",
    "✅ **Professional** - Works with existing product documentation"
